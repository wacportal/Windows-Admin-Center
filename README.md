# Windows Admin Center

You can update non-preview editions of Windows Admin Center either via Microsoft Update or by manually downloading and installing the software. Each non-preview release remains supported for 30 days following the release of the subsequent non-preview version. Refer to our support policy for additional details.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Windows Admin Center, ensure the following requirements are met:

* A Windows PC or server for the installation of Windows Admin Center.

* Administrative privileges or equivalent permissions on the target machine.

* Optional: An SSL certificate intended for *Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)*. For testing purposes, a self-signed certificate is acceptable, but for production deployments, use a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority. If you donâ€™t have a certificate, the Windows Admin Center installer can create a self-signed certificate valid for 60 days.
